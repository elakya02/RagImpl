This has been described pre-clinically with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents with varying mechanisms of action including taxanes, and (deoxyribonucleic acid) DNA-damaging agents.  In the clinic, activated PI3K pathway in tumors has been correlated with decreased response to therapy and worse clinical outcomes.\nIn addition to resistance to cytotoxic agents, there is also evidence of PI3K signaling affecting sensitivity of cells to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family signaling inhibitors.  Specifically, the activation of PI3K in tumors has been associated with a worse outcome in patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer treated with anti-HER2 agents. In addition, pre-clinical studies have described the role of the PI3K pathway in EGFR activation in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and have demonstrated that PI3K inhibitors can reverse resistance to EGFR inhibitors in tumor models."

Serum/Urine Pregnancy Test: For female patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed on two occasions prior to starting study therapy - once at the start of screening and once again at least 72 hours prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.  Pregnancy tests will also be routinely repeated at every cycle during the active treatment period, at the end of study therapy and whenever one menstrual cycle is missed or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected.  Additional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if requested by IRB/IECs or if required by local regulations.\nPF-05212384 (gedatolisib); PF-00299804\nB2151002"

Specifically, the activation of PI3K in tumors has been associated with a worse outcome in patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer treated with anti-HER2 agents. 18 Finally, pre-clinical studies have described the role of the PI3K pathway in EGFR activation in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and have demonstrated that PI3K inhibitors can reverse resistance to EGFR inhibitors in tumor models. 20"

TNBC tumor cells harbor activating mutations in the PIK3CA gene, making these cells excellent targets for inhibition of the PI3K pathway using pathway inhibitors, such as PF-05212384. 46\nIn addition, some fraction of TNBC tumor cells (~20%) harbor mutations in the DNA repair genes breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and breast cancer 2 (BRCA2), suggesting a functional deficit in the process of homologous recombination repair (HRR) of DNA.

To date, the terminal t\u00bd has been characterized in patients at 45 mg, and ranged from 75 to 110 hour with a mean of approximately 85 hours.\nDacomitinib is metabolized in part by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and an active metabolite, PF-05199265, is formed.  Dacomitinib also inhibits the CYP2D6 metabolic pathway.  Collectively results from clinical studies suggest that dacomitinib may increase exposure of other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 and therefore administration of drugs which are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism may require dose adjustment, or substitution with an alternative medication.  Dacomitinib is mainly eliminated by fecal excretion."
